# NE-oscillations
Code to reproduce figures in "Memory enhancing properties of sleep depend on the oscillatory amplitude of norepinephrine" by Kjaerby, Andersen, Hauglund, Untiet, Dall, Sigurdsson, Ding, Feng, Li, Weikop, Hirase, and Nedergaard (2022).

The code is ordered into folders with "scripts" containing scripts used for analysis and "functions" containing custom functions that are used in the scripts.

Additionally, we use a custom function provided by Tucker Davis Technologies called "TDTbin2mat" that you can find in [their repository](https://github.com/tdtneuro/TDTMatlabSDK)
